- 👋 Hi, I’m @DickDitty
- 👀 I’m a recent retiree returning to computer aided drafting/design as a benevolent hobby .
- 🌱 I’m currently delving into OpenSCAD(ver2021.01) for the first time, it reminds me of the old AutoCAD 10->12 DOS CAD programs; except much more open source.👍
- 💞️ I’m currently accepting donations of info/guidance corcerning this program in a most humble way.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is probably here on GitHub.
- I'm not new to GitHub; but it's so many decades since I compiled anything,please do use the newbie gloves on me.😀
